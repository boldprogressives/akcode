To install:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(in a virtualenv, hopefully)

Then:

cp local_settings.sample.py local_settings.py

And edit local_settings.py -- you'll need to provide credentials for your Actionkit
client-db connection and API credentials.  And remember to change the SECRET_KEY.

Then you can run manage.py syncdb and start your Django web server.

If you uncomment AKCODE_GIT_REPO and set it to a valid git URL that the server process
somehow has access to clone and push to, then you'll also get some git integration --
every time you save a change in a code snippet or checkout through the web, a git
commit will be created.

There's also a view at /changeset_added/ which you can use to wire up integration
from git commits to the application.  (This needs to be better documented; ask me
if you want to use it.)
